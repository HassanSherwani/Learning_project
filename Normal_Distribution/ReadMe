# Normal Distribution: Area Under curve<br>

The mean of a normal distribution determines the height of a bell curve. The standard deviation of a normal distribution determines the width or spread of a bell curve. The larger the standard deviation, the wider the graph.<br>
Percentiles represent the area under the normal curve, increasing from left to right.
