# Classifier
In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations whose category membership is known


# Dataset
Dataset that I am using is about users in social networks. It describes that social network has several business clients which can put their ads on the social network and one of their clients is a car company who has just launched their brand new luxury SUV for a ridiculous price. We're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand-new SUV.

Key variables/features are : 
User ID
Gener: Male or female
Age
Estimated Salary
Dependent Variable-Purchased: Categorical variable showing if item is purchased or not.

# Problem Statement



We are going to build a model that is going to predict if users choose to buy or not based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary

Goal is to find right users in right category. We will use different classifiers to predict user choice to purchase SUV or not. Additionally, we will check which model predicts the most accurate results.
