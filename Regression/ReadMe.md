# Regression

Regression is a statistical measure used in finance, investing and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other changing variables (known as independent variables).

There are different types of regression for analysis. We have used simple linear regression with one dependent and one independent variable, multiple regression( with one dependent variables and multiple independent variables),  Decision Tree regression, and Random Forest.
