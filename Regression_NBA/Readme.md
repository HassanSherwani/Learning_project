# Regression<br>
Regression is a statistical measure used in finance, investing and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other changing variables (known as independent variables).

There are different types of regression for analysis. We have used simple linear regression with one dependent and one independent variable.<br>
