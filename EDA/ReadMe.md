# EDA
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with
visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling
or hypothesis testing task.<br>

Significance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Data science is ubiquitous to advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.<br>
At a high level, EDA is the practice of describing the data by means of statistical and visualization techniques to bring important aspects
of that data into focus for further analysis.
