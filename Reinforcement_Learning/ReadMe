#Reinforcement-learning
Multi-armed bandit

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward

It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.

#Problem Statement

We are going to try optimizing the click-through rate of different users on an ad that we put on a social network.The department of marketing prepared some different versions of this same ad in different sceneries.So,they prepared different versions of the same ad that they would put on the social network but,the problem is that they're actually not very sure of which ad to put on the social network they want to put the ad that will get the maximum clicks. 
So, we need to help them in finding the ad that will lead to the best conversion rate.
We are going to solve this problem with the two most popular algorithms for this.These are the **upper confidence bound and Bayesian inference.**
